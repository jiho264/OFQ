# OFQ: Oscillation-free Quantization for Low-bit Vision Transformers
The training code for ViT, which was presented in our paper titled "Oscillation-free Quantization for Low-bit Vision Transformers" and has been accepted for ICML 2023, is included in this repository.

A version of our paper that is ready for publication will be completed soon, after which we will make the code and model weights available as open source.
